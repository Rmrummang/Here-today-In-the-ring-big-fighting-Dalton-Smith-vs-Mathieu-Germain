In The Ring: Dalton Smith vs Mathieu‚ÄÇGermain
Fight fans, welcome to a high-stakes battle in Sheffield where Dalton Smith defends his WBC Silver super lightweight title against Canadian‚ÄÇchallenger Mathieu Germain. The bout, which will take place‚ÄÇon April 19 at the Canon Medical Arena, is much more than a line on the boxing calendar ‚Äî it is a key intersection in the trajectories of the two fighters, with world-title stakes on the line.
Star From‚ÄÇSheffield Comes Home to Fight Week Atmosphere
Dalton Smith (17-0, 13‚ÄÇKOs) in front of his people, in front of his territory, the buzz is just unreal here in Sheffield. Smith,‚ÄÇwho is 28, is unbeaten and quickly climbing the world rankings. Smith‚Äôs momentum is undebatable, following a devastating first-round‚ÄÇstoppage victory over Walid Ouizza in January, to win the European title. This Saturday he looks to tally another victim and‚ÄÇput himself one step closer to a world title shot.
Smith and Germain went toe to‚ÄÇtoe this week, arms folded outside Sheffield City Hall, both men radiating a quiet confidence. For Smith, a chance‚ÄÇto shine at home; for Germain, a chance to put his career in focus.
Introducing the challenger: Mathieu Germain‚Äôs‚ÄÇworld tour
Mathieu Germain (26-2-1, 11 KOs) is 35 and is‚ÄÇrecognized as having rugged fights. She's on an eight-fight win streak and will be making her‚ÄÇinternational debut in the Steel City. A fighter with a depth of technical skill‚ÄÇand tenacity, Germain most recently defeated Carlos Daniel Aquino via seventh round stoppage in a signature win that earned him this eliminator opportunity.
Germain, at 6‚Ä≤1‚Ä≥, has a notable height advantage over the‚ÄÇ5‚Ä≤9¬Ω‚Äù Smith. Though crushed twice in defeat, both those‚ÄÇlosses came against credible fellas. He‚Äôs keen to demonstrate he can‚ÄÇbe on the world stage and is looking to throw a spanner in the works on the enemy‚Äôs real estate.
What‚Äôs at Stake?
This isn‚Äôt just about belts. The‚ÄÇwinner will also be a top contender for the 140 lbs WBC world title. That heady combination of speed, power and technicality has seen many consider Smith to be the next British world champion in the‚ÄÇweight class. But Germain is fighting for recognition and a shot‚ÄÇat the sport‚Äôs highest honor.
Undercard Highlights
The undercard is filled with‚ÄÇtalent:
The ex-world champion Josh Warrington is back at super featherweight‚ÄÇafter having a tussle with Asad Asif Khan.
Ryan Kelly‚ÄÇfaces Caoimhin Agyarko for the WBA Continental super welterweight strap.
Josh Padley vs Marko Cvetanovic: Lightweight fight for the WBA International‚ÄÇtitle
Two British prospects square off to kickstart the night with an all-English super featherweight‚ÄÇclash, as Giorgio Visioli meets Kane Baker.
Prediction and Final Thoughts
Smith is a solid favorite with‚ÄÇthe bookmakers, and with good reason. He is‚ÄÇyounger, fighting at home, and has a higher knockout ratio. But Germain‚Äôs experience and length could create‚ÄÇproblems if Smith isn‚Äôt fully focused on him. Smith will look to get out fast, put his power on you‚ÄÇand score a highlight-reel finish. But‚ÄÇGermain‚Äôs resilience means he isn‚Äôt done yet.
‚ÄúSmith is the bigger man and beats Germain in‚ÄÇevery category ‚Äî chin, power. Smith should also be approaching his prime‚ÄÇat this point in time, and should be able to come on aggressive and land clean. ‚ÄúWith Smith also‚ÄÇfighting at home, I‚Äôm confident we have no issues doing enough to get our hands raised and a finish in this one is a good shout.‚Äù 3
It would only be a problem if the fight night didn‚Äôt promise drama, skill and the sort of‚ÄÇatmosphere that only Sheffield can provide. Whether you root for the local hero‚ÄÇor the underdog, this is a match you won‚Äôt want to miss.
