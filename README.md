In The Ring: Dalton Smith vs Mathieu Germain
Fight fans, welcome to a high-stakes battle in Sheffield where Dalton Smith defends his WBC Silver super lightweight title against Canadian challenger Mathieu Germain. The bout, which will take place on April 19 at the Canon Medical Arena, is much more than a line on the boxing calendar — it is a key intersection in the trajectories of the two fighters, with world-title stakes on the line.
Star From Sheffield Comes Home to Fight Week Atmosphere
Dalton Smith (17-0, 13 KOs) in front of his people, in front of his territory, the buzz is just unreal here in Sheffield. Smith, who is 28, is unbeaten and quickly climbing the world rankings. Smith’s momentum is undebatable, following a devastating first-round stoppage victory over Walid Ouizza in January, to win the European title. This Saturday he looks to tally another victim and put himself one step closer to a world title shot.
Smith and Germain went toe to toe this week, arms folded outside Sheffield City Hall, both men radiating a quiet confidence. For Smith, a chance to shine at home; for Germain, a chance to put his career in focus.
Introducing the challenger: Mathieu Germain’s world tour
Mathieu Germain (26-2-1, 11 KOs) is 35 and is recognized as having rugged fights. She's on an eight-fight win streak and will be making her international debut in the Steel City. A fighter with a depth of technical skill and tenacity, Germain most recently defeated Carlos Daniel Aquino via seventh round stoppage in a signature win that earned him this eliminator opportunity.
Germain, at 6′1″, has a notable height advantage over the 5′9½” Smith. Though crushed twice in defeat, both those losses came against credible fellas. He’s keen to demonstrate he can be on the world stage and is looking to throw a spanner in the works on the enemy’s real estate.
What’s at Stake?
This isn’t just about belts. The winner will also be a top contender for the 140 lbs WBC world title. That heady combination of speed, power and technicality has seen many consider Smith to be the next British world champion in the weight class. But Germain is fighting for recognition and a shot at the sport’s highest honor.
Undercard Highlights
The undercard is filled with talent:
The ex-world champion Josh Warrington is back at super featherweight after having a tussle with Asad Asif Khan.
Ryan Kelly faces Caoimhin Agyarko for the WBA Continental super welterweight strap.
Josh Padley vs Marko Cvetanovic: Lightweight fight for the WBA International title
Two British prospects square off to kickstart the night with an all-English super featherweight clash, as Giorgio Visioli meets Kane Baker.
Prediction and Final Thoughts
Smith is a solid favorite with the bookmakers, and with good reason. He is younger, fighting at home, and has a higher knockout ratio. But Germain’s experience and length could create problems if Smith isn’t fully focused on him. Smith will look to get out fast, put his power on you and score a highlight-reel finish. But Germain’s resilience means he isn’t done yet.
“Smith is the bigger man and beats Germain in every category — chin, power. Smith should also be approaching his prime at this point in time, and should be able to come on aggressive and land clean. “With Smith also fighting at home, I’m confident we have no issues doing enough to get our hands raised and a finish in this one is a good shout.” 3
It would only be a problem if the fight night didn’t promise drama, skill and the sort of atmosphere that only Sheffield can provide. Whether you root for the local hero or the underdog, this is a match you won’t want to miss.
